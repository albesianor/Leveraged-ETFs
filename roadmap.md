# Roadmap
- simulate GBM and compute comparisons between stock and lETF (mean, median, std, VaR)
- plot mean, median, std, VaR as functions of factor and window size (can control), and infer some relationship
- plot mean, median, std, VaR as functions of drift and volatility (cannot control in real-world), and infer some relationship
- knowing drift and vol, can we adjust window size and factor to get similar distributions
- try to figure out a theoretical dependence
- price lETF
- hedge lETF
